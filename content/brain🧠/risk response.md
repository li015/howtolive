1. **Avoidance**: This strategy involves taking necessary actions to prevent the risk from posing a threat to the organization. Contractors usually opt for this option when dealing with health-threatening risks or when the risk does not align with the organization's low-risk appetite[2](https://www.constructconnect.com/blog/how-to-successfully-determine-your-risk-response-strategy-in-construction).
2. **Mitigation**: This approach aims to reduce the likelihood or impact of a risk event. Contractors may choose this option for risks that exceed their corresponding risk thresholds. For instance, a risk that may cause a delay of greater than 10 days can be mitigated if it surpasses the company’s relevant risk tolerance[2](https://www.constructconnect.com/blog/how-to-successfully-determine-your-risk-response-strategy-in-construction).
3. **Acceptance**: This strategy involves acknowledging the risk and its potential impact. Contractors may accept risks if the impacts are within the range of the company’s risk threshold. This approach is often taken when the cost of mitigating the risk outweighs the potential loss or when the risk is an inherent part of the project[2](https://www.constructconnect.com/blog/how-to-successfully-determine-your-risk-response-strategy-in-construction)[3](https://www.procore.com/library/construction-risk-management).
4. **Transfer**: This method involves shifting a risk to a third party, often through insurance programs or construction contracts. Contractors can pass on liability risks to insurers, for example, by signing up for a contractor liability insurance plan[2](https://www.constructconnect.com/blog/how-to-successfully-determine-your-risk-response-strategy-in-construction)[3](https://www.procore.com/library/construction-risk-management).
