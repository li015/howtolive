The **目标设置理论** (Goal-setting Theory) posits that setting clear and challenging goals directly impacts performance by motivating individuals and aligning their behavior towards specific objectives. Goals themselves act as incentives, converting personal needs into motivation and guiding behavior towards desired outcomes. Research indicates that well-defined goals with appropriate challenge levels and regular feedback lead to better motivational effects[1](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-cn/%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E8%AE%BE%E5%AE%9A%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA)[2](https://zh.wikipedia.org/zh-tw/%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E8%AE%BE%E5%AE%9A%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA)[3](https://wiki.mbalib.com/zh-tw/%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E8%AE%BE%E5%AE%9A%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA)[4](https://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E8%AE%BE%E5%AE%9A%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA).Key characteristics of effective goal setting include:

- **Specific Goals**: Clearly defined goals with measurable standards and completion timelines.
- **Appropriate Challenge**: Goals should be challenging but within the individual's capabilities to avoid boredom or frustration.
- **Feedback**: Regular feedback on goal achievement is essential for motivation and performance improvement.

The theory emphasizes that setting challenging goals can enhance performance by stimulating effort and directing focus, ensuring individuals understand expectations and allocate their resources effectively. Additionally, goals can sustain employees' endurance and enhance their performance over time[3](https://wiki.mbalib.com/zh-tw/%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E8%AE%BE%E5%AE%9A%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA)[4](https://wiki.mbalib.com/wiki/%E7%9B%AE%E6%A0%87%E8%AE%BE%E5%AE%9A%E7%90%86%E8%AE%BA).
