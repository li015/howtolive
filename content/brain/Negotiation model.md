 1. Setup and Participants

- **Participants**: The game involves participants who are assigned roles as either the owner utility or a contractor.
- **Context**: The simulation is set around the negotiation for the construction of a new gas pipeline, making it relevant to civil engineering.

2. Game Structure

- **Multiple Issues**: The negotiation covers multiple issues such as completion dates, penalties for late completion, bonuses for early completion, and specific contract terms like the type of contract (flat fee, cost-plus, etc.).
- **Predefined Issues**: All issues to be negotiated are predefined, which simplifies the process and focuses on negotiation skills rather than technical details.

3. Instructions and Information

- **Detailed Instructions**: Each participant receives detailed instructions that outline their role, objectives, and the context of the negotiation.
- **Additional Information**: Participants are provided with extra information relevant to their role, which they can choose to disclose or withhold during the negotiations as part of their strategy.

4. Scoring System

- **Point System**: A numerical scoring system is provided to participants, which helps them evaluate the desirability of different contract agreements based on various outcomes of the negotiation.
- **Interactions Among Issues**: The scoring system accounts for interactions among various issues, reflecting the complex trade-offs that can occur in real negotiations.
	1. **Final Success**:
    
    - **Definition**: Measures the rate at which successful deals are made by a specific agent (p1) at the end of the negotiation.
    - **Importance**: This metric is critical as p1's preferences often conflict with those of other parties, making it a stringent test of negotiation effectiveness.
2. **Any Success**:
    
    - **Definition**: Tracks the rate at which p1 achieves a successful deal at any point during the negotiation rounds.
    - **Purpose**: This allows for assessing p1's effectiveness across all negotiation stages, not just the final outcome.
3. **Own Score**:
    
    - **Definition**: Calculates the score of the deal proposed by any agent ùëùùëñpi from their own perspective.
    - **Relevance**: It evaluates whether agents are making compromises by proposing deals that may be less ideal for themselves but could facilitate agreement.
4. **Collective Score**:
    
    - **Definition**: Computes the average score of all deals proposed by an agent ùëùùëñpi, considered from the perspective of all agents involved.
    - **Utility**: This score provides an "oracle view" of the agent‚Äôs actions, assessing whether the agent's proposals are beneficial to all parties and promoting a collective agreement.
5. **Wrong Deals**:
    
    - **Definition**: Determines the rate of deals proposed by an agent ùëùùëñpi where the score is below the minimum acceptable threshold for that agent.
    - **Function**: This metric checks if the agents are adhering to the game's rules and whether they are performing accurate calculations in their proposals.
 5. Negotiation Process

- **Contract Form**: Negotiations are aimed at filling out a contract form that specifies agreements on each issue.
- **Role Play**: Participants engage in role-playing to negotiate with a designated partner, trying to reach the most favorable terms within the constraints of their assigned roles and information.

 6. Educational Focus

- **Learning Objectives**: The game is intended as an educational tool to help civil engineering managers develop practical negotiating skills and understand key principles of negotiation.
- **Laboratory Setting**: The controlled environment of the game allows for experimentation with different negotiating strategies without real-world consequences.

 7. Post-Game Analysis

- **Debriefing**: After the game, a debriefing session allows participants to reveal their instructions and discuss the negotiation outcomes. This helps identify potential improvements and understand the Pareto optimal agreements.
- **Educational Value**: Participants analyze their performance, strategies used, and the outcomes of negotiations, gaining insights into effective negotiation tactics and areas for personal improvement.
