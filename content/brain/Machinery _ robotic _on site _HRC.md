### Introduction
The management of construction workspaces and activities has garnered considerable scholarly and practical attention. Given the involvement of both human workers and machinery in construction projects, numerous investigations have sought to mitigate spatial and temporal conflicts inherent in coordinating multiple construction machines and their movements. This endeavor is driven by the overarching goal of enhancing both productivity and safety within construction contexts. 
While existing methodologies offer means for
	engineers to assess site planning from a logistical standpoint
	, facilitating the determination of potential site layouts and initial path planning for machine autonomy
, there remains the need for 
	on-site crews to adapt machine path planning in response to site-specific variability
	, 
Consequently, research endeavors are required to elucidate mechanisms for modifying the behavior of a group of machines/robots to align with revised goals, which may arise from a new decision made by a single machine.
Therefore, activities that entail coordination between humans and machines/robots need meticulous scrutiny.

Effective management of construction workspaces has stay significant attention in both research and practical applications. research aim at enhance productivity and safety have minimized spatial and temporal conflicts in coordination of various construction machines and their movements. Despite the method to help engineers evaluate the site plan from a logistics approach help determine the possible site layout and autonomous initial path planning, research on the discrete tasks that involes multiple human and machines is lack. This research goes into the collective behavior of the machines and workers from local interactions, and how it affect the tasks on site.  It is supposed that a desired collective behavior emerges from the interactions between the robots and interactions of robots with the environment. The objectives of this study are (1) to identify prominent themes in published research; (2) to compare work published within each theme; and (3) to suggest future directions for construction equipment space planning.

Effective management of construction workspaces has stay significant attention in both research and practical applications. In order to increase productivity and safety, researchers have minimized spatial and temporal conflicts when coordinating various construction machines and their movements. While there are methods to help engineers evaluate site planning from a logistical standpoint, helping to identify possible site layouts and autonomous initial path planning, research involving multiple discrete human and machine tasks is worth investigating. This study explores the collective behavior of machines and workers in localized interactions and how this behavior affects the field task. We argue that interactions between robots, as well as robot-environment interactions, produce desirable collective behavior.

The management of construction workspaces and activities has been of great interest in research and practical applications. Involving work projects carried out by workers and machines, multiple studies have been conducted to minimize spatial and temporal conflicts when coordinating various construction machines and their movements in order to improve productivity and safety. While there are methods to help engineers evaluate site planning from a logistical perspective to help determine possible site layouts and initial path planning for machine autonomy, field crews will need machines to readjust their path planning in response to the variability of the site, and research is needed to determine how to change the behavior of a group of machines to achieve a revised goal through a new decision made by a single machine. therefore work activities involving human and machine coordination still require careful observation. This study examines the collective behavior resulting from local interactions between machines and workers and how this behavior affects the conduct of a single field task. The process of this research involves (1) activity modeling for construction machine task planning, (2) modeling of group dynamics including human-machine team and machine coordination (3) assuming that automated machinery replaces the human team, and (4) proposing a possible framework for human-machine teamwork.
This approach involves computer vision in machine and human motion analysis, which will be simulated and validated in Building Information Modeling (BIM). This study provides possible models of human-robot collaboration that can help in the transition to fully automated construction.
