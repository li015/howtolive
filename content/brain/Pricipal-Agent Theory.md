The principal-agent problem refers to the conflict of interest that arises when one party (the agent) is acting on behalf of another party (the principal). The key issues are:

- The agent may have different priorities and interests than the principal[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem)[2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agencytheory.asp)[3](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/principal-agent-problem/)[4](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal-agent-problem.asp). For example, a CEO (agent) may focus on short-term profits and bonuses rather than the long-term growth desired by shareholders (principals)[2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agencytheory.asp)[4](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal-agent-problem.asp).
- The agent has more information and expertise than the principal, leading to information asymmetry[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem)[3](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/principal-agent-problem/). The principal cannot perfectly monitor the agent's actions.
- This creates agency costs, as the agent may take actions that benefit themselves but harm the principal[2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agencytheory.asp)[3](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/principal-agent-problem/)[4](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal-agent-problem.asp). The principal must incur costs to incentivize and monitor the agent.

To resolve the principal-agent problem, the interests of the agent and principal must be aligned[3](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/principal-agent-problem/)[4](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal-agent-problem.asp). Common solutions include:

- Designing contracts that incentivize the agent to act in the principal's interests, such as performance-based compensation[2](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/a/agencytheory.asp)[3](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/principal-agent-problem/)[4](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal-agent-problem.asp)
- Monitoring the agent's actions and tying their pay to outcomes[3](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/principal-agent-problem/)[4](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/principal-agent-problem.asp)
- Providing the agent with information to reduce information asymmetry[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem)

The principal-agent theory originated in the 1970s from the fields of economics and institutional theory[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem). It has applications in corporate governance, political science, and many other areas where one party acts on behalf of another[1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal%E2%80%93agent_problem)[3](https://corporatefinanceinstitute.com/resources/economics/principal-agent-problem/).
