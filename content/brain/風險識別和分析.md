1. 蒙特卡羅模擬 (Monte Carlo Simulation) 這是一種廣泛使用的計算機模擬技術,透過重複採樣隨機變數,並計算結果來近似解決問題。
	1. Monte Carlo simulation is a valuable tool for risk identification in construction projects, particularly in the international market (Nemuth, 2008). It can be used to assess and respond to various types of risks, including those that are complex and uncertain (Sharma, 2020). The technique can also be integrated with decision-makers' risk attitudes to prioritize project risks (Qazi, 2021). Furthermore, the use of Fuzzy Monte Carlo Simulation has been proposed to address both random and fuzzy uncertainties in risk assessment models for construction projects (Sadeghi, 2010).
2. 事件樹分析 (Event Tree Analysis) 將起因事件及其可能後果以樹狀結構展開,用以分析系統在各種情境的表現和風險。==taking into account whether installed safety barriers are functioning or not,==
	1. A range of studies have applied Event Tree Analysis (ETA) to construction risk identification. Abdollahzadeh (2015) used ETA to assess interruption risk in bridge construction, while Herweynen (2001) highlighted the potential for bias in risk estimation if event trees are oversimplified. Abdelgawad (2012) proposed a hybrid framework for risk analysis in construction, combining ETA with other methods. Yang (2015) applied Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) to identify the causes of high altitude falling accidents in construction, which could be further enhanced by incorporating ETA. These studies collectively underscore the value of ETA in construction risk identification, while also highlighting the need for careful application and integration with other risk analysis methods.
3. 故障模式與效應分析 (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis, FMEA) 系統性地檢視產品或過程中潛在的故障模式及其對系統的影響,並評估發生的風險。
	1. The use of Failure Mode and Effect Analysis (FMEA) in construction risk identification has been explored in several studies. Wehbe (2013) and Sharma (2019) both emphasize the importance of FMEA in identifying and mitigating risks in construction projects, with Wehbe specifically focusing on its integration into the Last Planner System. Mecca (2005) further supports this, presenting an FMEA procedure for analyzing risk factors in construction phases. Hernadewita (2020) expands on this by identifying FMEA as a practical tool for risk identification and assessment in the construction supply chain, particularly when combined with the Supply Chain Operation Reference (SCOR) method. These studies collectively highlight the value of FMEA in construction risk management, particularly in the identification and assessment of potential failure modes and their effects.
4. 靈敏度分析 (Sensitivity Analysis) 變更模型中的輸入參數,觀察對輸出結果的影響程度,以確認關鍵風險因子。
	1. Sensitivity analysis is a powerful analytical technique used to assess the impact of variations in input values on the outcome of a **mathematical model.** It is employed across various disciplines, including business, finance, environmental studies, engineering, physics, and chemistry, to evaluate the robustness of results and identify areas for improvement.
5. 情節分析 (Scenario Analysis)  
	構建一系列可能的情境,評估每種情境下風險暴露的程度。
		Scenario analysis is a strategic planning method used to develop flexible and robust plans by considering a range of plausible future states. It involves creating hypothetical scenarios that describe possible paths of development leading to specific outcomes. These scenarios are not predictions or forecasts but rather tools to challenge conventional wisdom and explore alternative futures that may significantly alter the basis for "business-as-usual" assumptions[](https://www.tcfdhub.org/scenario-analysis/)
1. 機率風險評估 (Probabilistic Risk Assessment) 結合事件樹、故障樹等技術,定量分析系統發生各類事故的機率。
2. 統計模型 (Statistical Models) 如常態分佈、指數分佈等,用以描述隨機事件發生的機率分佈。
3. 模糊邏輯 (Fuzzy Logic) 處理不確定性和模糊性,常用於風險評估中對質化指標進行量化。
