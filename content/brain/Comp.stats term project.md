### 1. Define the Objectives:
**Determine influencing factors:** Understand factors that contribute to spatial income variations.

### 2. Collect Data:
- [ ] **Income Data:** Obtain income data by region, such as median household income or per capita income.
- [x] **Geographical Boundaries:** Secure shapefiles or other geographical data for mapping.
- [ ] **Demographic and Economic Data:** Collect additional data that might correlate with income, such as education levels, unemployment rates, and industry distribution.

### 3. Data Preparation:
- **Cleaning:** Ensure the data is clean, accurate, and formatted correctly.
- **Normalization:** Adjust for differences in cost of living, if comparing different regions.
- **Integration:** Combine income data with geographical and other relevant data.

### 4. Analysis Methods:

- **Descriptive Statistics:** Calculate basic statistics like mean, median, and standard deviation of income.
- **Spatial Autocorrelation:** Determine if income levels in nearby locations are correlated using measures like Moran's I or Geary's C.
- **Hot Spot Analysis:** Identify clusters of high or low income using techniques like Getis-Ord Gi*.
- [ ] **Regression Analysis:** Understand how various factors (like education or infrastructure) correlate with income levels.
- [ ] **半變異函數分析 (Semivariogram Analysis)**

- **描述**: 用於空間統計中，分析樣本點間的空間相關性。
- **應用**: 分析降雨量的空間結構，並且與地形特徵（如等高線）進行比較，來理解降雨的空間連續性如何受到地形的影響。


### 5. Visualization:

- **Thematic Maps:** Create maps to visualize income distribution, such as choropleth maps.
- **Scatter Plots:** Display relationships between income and other variables.
- **3D Maps:** Use elevation or color gradients to represent income levels in a more immersive context
