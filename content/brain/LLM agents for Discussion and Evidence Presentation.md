## Introduction

- general background information: automation in constuction industry
- Literature review: present automation development and adoption
- Establish a niche: evidential, proactive, bidirection
	occupying the niche
	- 
- Purpose of research: enahnce trust

	In order to enhance trustworthiness of LLM agents, it is essential for it to debate and provide evidence in response to a query. This area of LLM research is very important since it has a direct bearing on the reliability and practicality of LLM agents in a range of real-world settings, from professional advisory jobs to support for academic research. Combinations* of interactive, conversational abilities, evidence-based reasoning, and possibly elements of role-specific adaptations should be examined. This field of study includes:
	- Data Retrieval and Integration: How LLMs access and integrate external data sources to support their responses.
	- Argumentation Skills: The ability of LLMs to construct logical, coherent arguments, and to present evidence in a structured and persuasive manner.
	- Critical Thinking and Analysis: How these models analyze questions and scenarios, distinguish between different types of evidence, and evaluate the relevance and reliability of information.
	- Interactive Learning: The capability of LLMs to learn from interactions and feedback to improve their evidence presentation and argumentation skills over time.
