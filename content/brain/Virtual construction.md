 Zhang et al. [[36](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0926580517300456?pes=vor#bb0180)] indicated that there are four essential elements that must be involved:
  (1) physical objects (e.g., buildings or equipment); 
  (2) construction information (e.g., quantity, schedule, or cost); 
  (3) realistic 3-D models including geometric and authentic information; and 
  (4) animations to depict the process.
