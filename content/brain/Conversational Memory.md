##### [notes :: 
To avoid excessive token usage, we can set a _window_ of interactions to store. For example, we can keep the **previous ten interactions** and drop anything beyond that window. This method avoids excessive token usage _but_ means we have no long-term conversational memory.

Alternative methods revolve around summarization. We can **summarize** a conversation and update the summary as a conversation progresses. Naturally, we lose information but avoid excessive token usage for long conversations.
