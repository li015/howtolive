### Types of Agents

- **Reactive Agents:** Respond to changes in the environment in a timely manner.
- **Deliberative Agents:** Use models of the world, including planning capabilities, to make decisions.
- ### Applications of MAS

1. **Distributed Problem Solving:** Used in complex problems like disaster response, where multiple agents work together to find a solution.
2. **Simulation:** In social sciences, economics, and ecology to simulate the behavior of complex systems and study their dynamics.
3. **Robotics:** Multiple robots coordinate to complete tasks such as search and rescue operations, cleaning, or assembly.
4. **Internet Applications:** Autonomous agents handle tasks such as data retrieval, filtering, or trading in online marketplaces.
5. 
### Benefits of MAS

- **Scalability:** Systems can be expanded by adding more agents.
- **Robustness:** The failure of one or more agents doesn't necessarily lead to system failure.
- **Flexibility:** Agents can be reprogrammed or replaced without disrupting the entire system.
- **Parallelism:** Multiple agents can work concurrently, leading to faster problem-solving.]
