沒有找到關於EIR and risk allocation 的題目
應該是因為EIR沒有辦法說明 廠商間的合約關係

“information management requirements”, “supplier risk management”, “risk allocation in construction”, “contractual risk”, “BIM and risk management”
“EIR”, “Engineer Information Requirement”, “risk allocation”, “construction”, “project management”


 The successful implementation of BIM also depends on addressing emerging contractual and legal risks, such as those related to documentation, intellectual rights, and liability (Almarri, 2019).
 To address these issues, a three-stage BIM-based risk management methodology has been proposed, which can be applied to construction projects to analyze and mitigate risks (Papachatzi, 2019).

**Risk Analysis Techniques:**

- **Risk Premium**: Added margins to cover unforeseen contingencies.
- **Risk Adjusted Discount Rate**: Adjusts future earnings for risk.
- **Subjective Probability**: Uses past project experiences to estimate risk.
- **Decision Analysis**: Includes tools like algorithms, mean end analysis, Bayesian theory, and decision trees.
- **Sensitivity Analysis**: Evaluates impact of variable changes on a project.
- **Monte Carlo Simulation**: Stochastic simulation for outcome probabilities.
- **Stochastic Dominance**: Assesses risk in decisions under uncertainty.
- **Caspar**: Computer-aided simulation for comprehensive project review.
- **Intuition**: Reliance on personal judgment and experience.
