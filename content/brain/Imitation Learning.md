[note :: IL can be divided into two categories: learning from demonstration [[LfD]] and learning from observation [[LfO]]

the former demands both states and actions whereas the latter only needs states.

 LfD is more straightforward because expert references provide direct action guidance to the imitator.
in terms of LfO, the agent is required to figure out the right action to generate state transitions that are similar to the expert ones
